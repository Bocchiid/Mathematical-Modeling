# 2026 MCM Problem C: Data With The Stars
**Date:** January 31, 2026

## Project Overview
Analyzing Dancing with the Stars (DWTS) data to develop mathematical models for fan vote estimation and voting system evaluation.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Develop Mathematical Model for Fan Vote Estimation ?
**Objective:** Create a model to estimate unknown fan votes for each contestant across seasons 1-34.

**Requirements:**
- Build mathematical model(s) to reverse-engineer fan votes from:
  - Judge scores (provided)
  - Elimination results (who was eliminated each week)
  - Voting combination method used (ranks vs. percentages)
  
- **Validation Metrics:**
  - Does the model correctly predict eliminations?
  - Provide quantitative consistency measures
  - Analyze certainty/confidence in estimates
  - Determine if certainty varies by contestant/week

**Key Constraints:**
- Seasons 1-2 & 28-34: Combined by RANK
- Seasons 3-27: Combined by PERCENTAGE
- Multiple valid fan vote solutions may exist for each week
- Judge scores: 1-10 (may include decimals, bonuses, team averages)

**Deliverables:**
- Fan vote estimates for all contestants/weeks
- Consistency validation with elimination results
- Confidence measures and uncertainty analysis

### Task 2-5: (Future)
- Compare rank vs. percentage methods
- Analyze controversial cases (Jerry Rice, Bobby Bones, etc.)
- Model dancer and celebrity characteristic impacts
- Propose alternative voting system
